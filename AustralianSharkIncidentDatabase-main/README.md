The <em><strong>Australian Shark-Incident Database</strong></em> (ASID), formerly known as the <em><strong><a href="https://taronga.org.au/conservation-and-science/australian-shark-attack-file">Australian Shark Attack File</a></strong></em> (ASAF), quantifies temporal and spatial patterns of shark-human interactions in Australia.
<br>
<br>
The <em><strong>Australian Shark-Incident Database</strong></em> is a joint partnership with <a href="https://taronga.org.au/conservation-and-science/our-contribution">Taronga Conservation Society Australia</a>, along with <a href="http://www.flinders.edu.au">Flinders University</a>, and the <a href="https://www.dpi.nsw.gov.au">New South Wales Department of Primary Industries</a>
<br>
<br>
Maintained as an uninterrupted record by a few committed Taronga team members since 1984, the File currently comprises > 1000 individual investigations from 1791 to today, making it the most comprehensive database of its kind available.

The Excel workbook '<strong><a href="http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5612260">Australian Shark-Incident Database_Public Version.xlsx</a></strong>' contains the living file that will be updated regularly by collaborators. Note that some information has been removed from the public version of ASID to protect the privacy of relevant persons involved. The column descriptors are as follows:
