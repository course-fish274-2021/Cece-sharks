## Project Concept

In this project, I will be exploring data outlining shark attacks in Australia from 1791 until the present day. 


## Data: Is there a correlation between provoked and fatal attacks? 
```{r}
ggplot(data = top_sharks, mapping = aes(x = Provoked.unprovoked, y = Recovery.status)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x= "Provoked or Unprovoked", y= "Human Recovery Status") +
  facet_wrap(~Provoked.unprovoked)
```
