## Project Concept: Australian Shark Attack Data 

In this project, I will be exploring data outlining shark attacks in Australia from 1791 until the present day. I want to know if there is a correlation between fatal and provoked attacks, and what types of sharks are most likely to participate in provoked vs unprovoked attacks. 

## Questions explored in this presentation 

1. Is there a correlation between if an attack is provoked and if the person was killed?
2. What kind of shark is most likely to participate in a provoked vs an unprovoked attack?

## Question 1 Graph: Is there a correlation between provoked and fatal attacks?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = fatality_data, mapping = aes(x = Provoked.unprovoked, y = Recovery.status)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="darkseagreen2") +
  theme(axis.ticks.y=element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank())+
  labs(x= "Provoked or Unprovoked Attack", y= "Human Recovery Status: Fatal")
```

## Question 1 Conclusion: Is there a correlation between provoked and fatal attacks? 

*Conclusion:* 
- More fatal unprovoked attacks, why? 
- Australian data
- Sharks may mistake people on surfboards for seals

## Question 2 Graph: What kind of shark is most likely to participate in a provoked vs an unprovoked attack?

```{r, echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data=filtered_data_sharks, mapping = aes(x = Provoked.unprovoked, y = Shark.common.name)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity", color="aquamarine3", na.rm=TRUE) +
  theme(axis.ticks.y=element_blank(), axis.text.y=element_blank())+
  labs(x="Provoked or Unprovoked Attack", y = "Shark Type") +
  facet_wrap(~Shark.common.name)
```

## Question 2 Conclusion: What kind of shark is most likely to participate in a provoked vs an unprovoked attack?

*Conclusion:* 
- Great White sharks most likely to attack unprovoked
- Could be related to seal diet 
- Bull sharks known as aggressive, but eat smaller prey
