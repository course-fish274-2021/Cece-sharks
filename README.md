# Cece-sharks

OVERVIEW: 
My project is based on Australian Shark Incident Data from Corey Bradshaw on GitHub. 
The data gives us an outline of more than 1100 shark attacks from 1791 to the present. 
It includes variables such as if the attack was provoked or unprovoked, if the person who was attacked was injured or uninjured, and what kind of shark (from either white shark, bull shark, tiger shark, or other) committed the attack. 

DIRECTORY STRUCTURE: 
All of the scripts, data, etc, can be found in the "AustralianSharkIncidentData-main" folder in labeled folders. The script & RMarkdown file for this project can be found in the "scripts" folder within the "AustralianSharkIncidentData-main" folder.

QUESTIONS: 
With this data, I will be addressing a few questions, as follows:
1. Is there a correlation between if an attack is provoked and if the person was killed?
2. What kind of shark is most likely to participate in a provoked vs an unprovoked attack?
